                <p> After amassing six gold medals in major national and international competitions, Indian-American pianist Rishi Mirchandani <a href="#ravel">debuted</a> as soloist with the Grammy award-winning Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at the age of 18. He made his first of four appearances at Carnegie Hall in New York at age 12, and he has performed to critical acclaim in England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United States.</p>
            
                <p>Mirchandani holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, <i>summa cum laude</i>, from Yale University. He earned Distinction in Mathematics and was one of twelve students from his class (top 1%) admitted to the Phi Beta Kappa honour society as a third-year. While pursuing his mathematics studies, he also studied piano with Elizabeth Parisot and founded the <a href="http://yalepiano.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yale Undergraduate Piano Collective</a>. At commencement, he received the Stanton Wheeler and Marcia Chambers Award for outstanding artistic contributions to campus life.</p>
            
                <p>Mirchandani subsequently moved to New York to focus on music professionally. He completed his master's degree in piano at the Manhattan School of Music with Jeffrey Cohen and Solomon Mikowsky, sponsored as a winner of the President’s Award. He then earned a Professional Studies Diploma at the Mannes School of Music, studying with Thomas Sauer, and won the coveted Steinway Award for artistic excellence and service to Mannes. Mirchandani quickly became a New York audience favourite as a soloist, chamber musician, and song pianist, receiving invitations to appear at Carnegie Hall, the Bohemian National Hall, the German Consulate of the U.N., the Union Club, Klavierhaus, and many other renowned venues in the city.</p>

                <p>Now based in London, Mirchandani is currently pursuing an Artist Diploma at the Royal College of Music. He is a student of Dmitri Alexeev, Ian Jones, and Andrew Zolinsky. He receives sponsorship from the institution as an RCM Scholar.</p>
            
                <p>He has received additional guidance from <a href="#langlang">Lang Lang</a>, Richard Goode, Boris Berman, Robert McDonald, and Eldar Nebolsin. Mirchandani's recording of Nancy Galbraith's Three Preludes for Piano was featured on the acclaimed Centaur Records album <i>Strange Travels</i>, which garnered a spot on the "Want List" in <i>Fanfare Magazine</i>.</p>
            
                <p>A native of Pittsburgh, Mirchandani studied as a child with Luz Manr&#237;quez. Now a committed teacher himself, he maintains a successful private studio and has been a Teaching Artist for <a href="https://www.midoriandfriends.org/">Midori & Friends</a>.
