                <p> After amassing six gold medals in major national and international competitions, Indian-American pianist Rishi Mirchandani <a href="#ravel">debuted</a> as soloist with the Grammy award-winning Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at the age of 18. He made his first of four appearances at Carnegie Hall in New York at age 12, and he has performed to critical acclaim in England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United States.</p>
            
                <p>Mirchandani holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, <i>summa cum laude</i>, from Yale University. He earned Distinction in Mathematics and was one of twelve students (top 1%) in his year admitted to the Phi Beta Kappa honour society as a third-year student. While pursuing his mathematics studies, he also studied piano with Elizabeth Parisot and founded the <a href="http://yalepiano.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yale Undergraduate Piano Collective</a>. At commencement, he received the Stanton Wheeler and Marcia Chambers Award for outstanding artistic contributions to campus life.</p>
            
                <p>Mirchandani subsequently moved to New York to focus on music professionally. He completed his master's degree in piano at the Manhattan School of Music with Jeffrey Cohen and Solomon Mikowsky, sponsored as a winner of the President’s Award. He then earned a Professional Studies Diploma at the Mannes School of Music, where he studied with Thomas Sauer and won the coveted Steinway Award for artistic excellence and service to Mannes. Mirchandani quickly became a New York audience favourite as a soloist, chamber musician, and song pianist, receiving invitations to appear at Carnegie Hall, the Bohemian National Hall, the German Consulate of the U.N., the Union Club, Klavierhaus, and many other renowned venues in the city.</p>

                <p>Now based in London, Mirchandani recently completed his Artist Diploma at the Royal College of Music. He was a student of Dmitri Alexeev, Ian Jones, and Andrew Zolinsky. He received sponsorship from the institution as an RCM Scholar.</p>
            
                <p>He has received additional guidance from <a href="#langlang">Lang Lang</a>, Richard Goode, Boris Berman, Robert McDonald, and Eldar Nebolsin. Mirchandani's recording of Nancy Galbraith's Three Preludes for Piano was featured on the acclaimed Centaur Records album <i>Strange Travels</i>, which garnered a spot on the "Want List" in <i>Fanfare Magazine</i>.</p>
            
                <p>A native of Pittsburgh, Mirchandani studied as a child with Luz Manr&#237;quez. Now a committed teacher himself, Mirchandani will join the teaching staff of the U.K.'s renowned Charterhouse School in September 2025 and also maintains a successful private studio. His students routinely receive top honours in exams and competitions, including invitations to perform in Carnegie Hall. He previously taught undergraduate piano proficiency at the Mannes School of Music and served as a Teaching Artist for <a href="https://www.midoriandfriends.org/">Midori & Friends</a>. In 2024, he gave a masterclass as a guest artist at the Carnegie Mellon University Preparatory School of Music. He believes earnestly in music’s ability to help human beings discover their inner power, natural grace, and shared humanity.</p>
